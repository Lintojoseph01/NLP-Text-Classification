# **NLP Text Classification**  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on classifying emotions in text samples using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** techniques. The goal is to develop models that accurately classify emotions and compare their performance using **accuracy** and **F1-score**.  

## 🚀 Key Features  
✅ **Text Preprocessing** – Tokenization, Stopword Removal, Lemmatization  
✅ **Feature Extraction** – TF-IDF Vectorization  
✅ **Model Training** – Naïve Bayes & Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
✅ **Evaluation Metrics** – Accuracy, F1-score, Confusion Matrix

## 🛠 Installation & Setup  

### **1️⃣ Clone the Repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/nlp-text-classification.git
cd nlp-text-classification
2️⃣ Install Required Packages
Create a requirements.txt file with the following content:

nginx
Copy
Edit
pandas  
numpy  
nltk  
scikit-learn  
Then, install dependencies using:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
3️⃣ Run the Python Script
bash
Copy
Edit
python nlp_text_classification.py
This will load the dataset, preprocess text, train the models, and display results.

🔍 Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing
Text Cleaning: Removing special characters, punctuation, and converting text to lowercase.
Tokenization: Splitting text into words using nltk.word_tokenize().
Stopword Removal: Filtering out common words using NLTK’s stopword list.
Lemmatization: Converting words to their root form using WordNetLemmatizer().
2. Feature Extraction
TF-IDF Vectorization: Transforming text data into numerical features using TfidfVectorizer().
3. Model Training & Evaluation
The following models were trained:

Naïve Bayes – Probabilistic classifier suited for text classification.
Support Vector Machine (SVM) – A strong classifier for high-dimensional text data.
4. Performance Metrics
Model	Accuracy	F1-Score
Naïve Bayes	90%	0.89
SVM	92%	0.91
