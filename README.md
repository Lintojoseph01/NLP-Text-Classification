# Emotion Classification in Text Samples  

## Project Overview  
This project focuses on classifying emotions in text samples using machine learning techniques.  
Models such as **Naive Bayes** and **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** were trained and evaluated on text data.  

## Key Steps  
- **Preprocessing**: Text cleaning, tokenization, and stopword removal.  
- **Feature Extraction**: TF-IDF Vectorization.  
- **Model Training**: Naive Bayes and SVM classifiers.  
- **Evaluation**: Accuracy and F1-score comparison.  

## Results  
| Model  | Accuracy |  
|--------|----------|  
| Naive Bayes | 90% |  
| SVM | 92% |
