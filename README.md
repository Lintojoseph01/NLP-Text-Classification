## Emotion Classification in Text Samples
Project Overview
This project focuses on classifying emotions in text samples using machine learning techniques. The goal was to develop models that can accurately identify emotions from text, and compare their performance based on metrics such as accuracy and F1-score.

Key Components
1. Loading and Preprocessing 
The dataset was loaded, and necessary preprocessing steps were performed, including:

Text cleaning: Removing special characters, punctuation, and converting text to lowercase.
Tokenization: Splitting the text into individual words.
Stopword removal: Removing common words that don't contribute to emotion classification.
These preprocessing techniques helped enhance model performance by reducing noise and standardizing the input data.

2. Feature Extraction 
I implemented feature extraction using TfidfVectorizer (or CountVectorizer). This step transformed the text data into numerical features, converting each document into vectors of term frequencies (or TF-IDF values), which are then used as inputs to the machine learning models.

3. Model Development 
I trained the following machine learning models:

Naive Bayes: A probabilistic classifier well-suited for text classification tasks.
Support Vector Machine (SVM): A powerful classifier that works effectively with high-dimensional data like text features.
4. Model Comparison 
The models were evaluated using metrics such as accuracy and F1-score. I provided an explanation of the performance of each model and discussed the suitability of these models for emotion classification in text.

Results
Naive Bayes Accuracy: 90%
SVM Accuracy: 92%

Conclusion
The project successfully implemented and compared two machine learning models for emotion classification from text samples. Based on the evaluation metrics, the most suitable model was determined
